<h1>Nexus Artifact Usage Plugin</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The nexus-artifact-usage-plugin provides visibility into how a particular artifact is used within your Nexus repo.  It tracks what artifacts in your
repo have dependencies to the artifact in question and allows you to walk that dependency tree in reverse.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Simply download the <a href="">latest stable release bundle</a> and drop it into your <pre>plugin-repository</pre> folder.  The next time you start
Nexus, you should notice a new tab when selecting an artifact called "Artifact Usage".</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>That tab will essentially be empty until you create a task that will automatically calculate the artifact usage data for you.  This is because Nexus
doesn't inherently track this information, so we have to crawl through the repository to get that data.  By going to the "Scheduled Tasks" section of
Nexus, you can create a new task of type "Recalculate Artifact Usage" for all of the repositories and just set the recurrence to "Manual".</p>
<p>Once you do this, the processing should automatically start without you even having to run it.  Keeping this task around will also automatically
trigger a calculation of the artifact usage whenever you restart Nexus.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The plugin also recognizes whenever a new artifact gets into the repository (either because of a cache dependency resolution or getting deployed into
the repository) or an artifact gets deleted and automatically updates the artifact usage information.  However, if you ever feel like the data might
not be up-to-date, you can always run the manual scheduled task you created earlier.</p>
<p>Now, when you click on a particular artifact in a repository and navigate to the Artifact Usage tab, you should see a tree of artifact that use the
artifact you've selected.  You can drill into this to get a full usage tree, or you can click the "Download" button to download a file that contains
the full tree of artifacts.</p>
<h2>What's Next</h2>
<p>There's plenty more to do to make this even easier to work with, and you can track those new features on the <a
